      My love for this band was born back in November 2023 when i first heard
      them suopport VUKOVI @ Cathouse. It was one of thier biggest shows to
      date. As soon as they took to the stage, that was it! Absolutley BLOWN
      AWAY! <br /><br />

      Lo Rays are Glasgow based, but thier members hail from Finland, England
      and Scotland. Thier sound, other than, EPIC is so unique, made up of,<q
        >glitchy synths, pop hooks and metal riffs.</q
      >

      My wife and I were so mesmerised by the set @ Cathouse, we had to tell
      them after the show how awesome it was. We met Laura, who was genuinely
      thee nicest person ever! She gave us some stickers and chatted for a
      little bit.
      <br /><br />
      On the way home, we binged the Lo Rays YouTube channel and follwed them on
      everything, now we are hooked! We've seen them three times, even taking
      time off work to follow them to Aberdeen. We can't wait for more shows!!!
